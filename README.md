I don't know about you, but I love Spotify. More specifically, I love Spotify Wrapped and other various features that break down personal listening / user history.

So, here's some of the personal Spotify data I've played around with in R and Python to try and recreate some of the statistics / analysis Spotify provides around the holiday season.

I've attached my own listening history files, as well as the R files and Google Colab Notebook I began my analysis in. Feel free to take this as inspiration to analyze your own data!

Note: There are multiple datasets used for different analysis purposes. You will find folders containing the different approaches:

1. I opted for the download with a quick turn-around time. It took about a week to recieve data that recorded listening history over the course of 1 year.
2. The Extended Streaming History shows my whole life with Spotify. This includes listening habits since I became a Spotify user.

Also -- see branch including a short presentation of my analysis. Enjoy!
