I don't know about you, but I love Spotify. More specifically, I love Spotify Wrapped and other various features that break down personal listening / user history.

So, here's some of the personal Spotify data I've played around with in R to try and recreate some of the statistics / analysis Spotify provides around the holiday season.

I've attached my own listening history files, as well as the R file I began my analysis in. Feel free to take this as inspiration to analyze your own data!

Note: I opted for the download with a quick turn-around time. It took about a week to recieve data that recorded listening history over the course of 1 year. There are other options available.
